---This file is intended to help users creating their own balance---


The simulator reads some files placed in /src

Game_balance (damage chart, climate data, terrain data?)
Unit_balance (all unit data)
CO_balance (all command_officer data)

You will need Game_balance before Unit_balance and CO_balance.
When loading Unit_balance, it checks if ALL the specified units are in the Game_balance damage chart.



The difference between normal effects and CO powers... [TODO]



The only things hardwritten in the simulator and therefore unchangeable are...

Category management : Each unit has a cost, range, movement... you must set a value in them even if it's 0. Notably for the weapon : Weapon 1 always has limited ammo and Weapon 2 always has unlimited ammo. Each CO has a normal effect in a CO-zone (it can be empty but you must set a value for CO_zone_size and CO_zone_type). However he doesn't require either a COP or SCOP.
Some core mechanics of Advance Wars : Capture the Q.G or rout all enemy units to win, luck mechanics (you can only modify the min/MAX values), terrain data (however you can edit the movement chart with practicability for each terrain/unit) ...
Fog of War. However this is an optionnal feature, plus there's only a single effect (which is limited vision). For instance you can create climates which include FoW, or create climates which simulate another type of FoW.
Enemy coverage in CO powers. In a game with more than 2 players, when a player uses a CO power with some effects intended to affect enemy, it will ALWAYS affect units of ALL enemy armies.
However you may pseudo-desactivate a large number of mechanics if you don't want them. See section "How to play without..." [TODO]



How to play without...
Ranked units : Play a game with "Ranking up" set as No. / You can use the command ranked_units in CO building.
Climate : Play a game with "Climate" set as "Set", specify Sun or any climate that doesn't do anything. / [TODO]
CO (create a list of banned COs in a map) : Play a game with "CO ban" set as Yes, then specify the COs.
CO powers (<=> creating a CO that don't have COP/SCOP and not considered as a default CO) : In CO building, directly write a separator after the CO-zone effect (this skip COP and SCOP building). Alternatively you can write a power name followed by ": NOPE" or nothing.
Fog of War : Play a game with "Fog of War" set as No.
Luck system : Currently no intention to create an option ingame / You can set the min/MAX luck values to 0, in CO building.
Unit (create a list of banned units in a map) : Play a game with "Unit ban" set as Yes, then specify the units.

TODO : Maybe regroup all commands in modify_x and add a [mode] which specifies "increase", "decrease", "set". With some exceptions eg. set_climate does something different than modify_climate.


special_missile : meteorite.PNG most_value 1 centered 3 enemy {set_health : 1}
special_missile : lightning.PNG most_units 1 square 3 enemy {decrease_HP : 3, set_state : waiting 1}


Special effects : Must be placed between the name of command and the separator ':'

An effect can take place during your turn only of the enemies' turn only. In that case, use 'phase="Ally"' or 'phase="Enemy"' (can be abreviated to "A" or "E"). Default value is "ALL".
+
You can add the number of turns an effect will last. The default value for normal effects is 'turns=0', which will function as long as the CO-zone is here. All CO power effects last 1 turn by default so default value for power is 'turns=1.' It is advised to use only 'turns=2' if necessary. At 3 turns or more, you may use a CO power again before the effect ends, leading to unexpected results. (You can decide to block CO powers usage during that time)
Please don't use turn-based effects as normal effects or the infinite turn value in powers (or add a condition ?).
+
To delay a power by a certain amount of turns : You can use 'delay=1' or more turns. They will be stocked and used accordingly. Please note that if you use a sufficiently high number, you can use this power several times before the first delayed effect takes into account, leading to unexpected results.
If used in the normal effect, it will begin effect x turns after effects set at delay=0.
+
Adding 'effect="Global"' will make this effect bypass the CO-zone. Adding 'effect="COzone"' will LIMIT this effect to the CO-zone.
To apply an effect to all places except COZone (used in Larissa's COP) make two commands, one command for applying the bonus with 'effect="Global"', and since you only want this outside COZone, one command for reverting this bonus with 'effect="COZone"'.
+
You can write effects taken into account without activating CO powers with 'passive=True'.
Conditional normal effects will have 'passive=False' and use (something that updates under condition).

[TODO]
+
Example : 'bonus phase="Ally" turns=2 delay=1 effect="Global" passive=False : +20/+20 ALL'
Default values of normal effects are 'phase="ALL" turns=0 delay=0 effect="COzone" passive=True'
Default values of power effects (COP, SCOP) are 'phase="ALL" turns=1 delay=0 effect="Global" passive=False'


Note for all [amount] arguments : You can use idioms like 'full', 'half', 'quarter', 'equal', 'keep' ... [TODO]
Note for all [modifier] arguments : This is a String argument which requires a specific value. You can use '=' to set it to a number, '+' or '-' to modify it. Using an 'equal' idiom for both [modifier] and [amount] arguments will not modify a value, useful for some effects.
Note for all [unit_affect] arguments : You can use groups of units that are already defined (therefore you don't need to write the command for each single unit). 'ALL' or 'ALL_ally' to specify all of your units (ally). 'ALL_foe' or 'ALL_enemy' to specify all enemy units. Use both in two commands to specify all units regardless of their army (may not be interesting, but it's here...). Default value is 'ALL'.

Note for capture values : The soldier units retain their default capture points if you don't modify them.
Note for HP VS health : You can use health to set more precise values. Modifying HP will round up the health by default, so use modify_health if you want to give EXACTLY x HP to your units for ex. If a unit has 61% health (7 HP), increase_health 10 returns 71%, increase_HP 1 returns the default value for a 8 HP unit, therefore 80%. Most AWDS CO will use increase_HP and decrease_HP.
aiming_mode : Most value ; Most units ; Random ; User choice... (only counts enemy units)






THE COMMAND LIST IN UNIT_BALANCE
Only used at the end of a Unit : The next lines after the weapon specifications are treated as expressions. They are separated by newlines or ';' (you can do both at the same time). It ends at a separator "***". Within an expression, you can pass an argument as the required type or a list, in that case separate the elements by ',' (no spaces).
Example :
can_capture "HQ","City" ; can_transport "Infantry" ; not_transportable
***

can_capture [terrain] : Followed by an argument specifying a type of terrain. You can use names defined as a terrain group. Attention : ALL terrain must have the property "Capturable" or they will be skipped.
Example : can_capture "HQ","City"

can_transport [unit] : This unit can transport other units. Attention : ALL units must not have the property "not_transportable" or they will be skipped.

ressource [unit|terrain] [number] : Followed by an argument specifying what the unit can build and another argument which is the number of max. ressources. If you specify a unit, make sure the "builder" can transport it !
	Unit :
	terrain : 
Examples : ressource Seaplane 4
ressource Temp_Properties 1

special_weapon {series_of_arguments...} : A special weapon that illuminates some squares of the map. But you can do more than that ! Here are all the properties and their default value : weapon=1 range=5 effect_range=2 illuminate=True modify_health=0 modify_att=0 modify_def=0 affect_ally="No" affect_ally_opt=["health","att","def"] set_att=-1 set_def=-1
	affect_ally : If you want to give an effect to your units, use this option with "Same" or "Inverted". "Same" or "S" applies the same values of all the options specified in affect_ally_opt (please use only health, att, def). "Inverted" or "I" applies the inverted value ! Ex. for modify_att=-40 affect_ally="I" : Enemy units -40% att and Ally units +40% att. !
	modify_health effect is instant. modify_att and modify_def work for the current turn.
	set_att and set_def are often used with 100 in order to ignore offensive or defensive bonuses. Does not account if set at a negative number (if set at 0, can lead to extreme results because the att or def stat will be set at 0 !). Works for the current turn and overwrites modify_att and modify_def.
Example : special_weapon weapon=1 range=3 illuminate=False modify_health=-10 => In lieu of illuminating an area, the flare does 10% damage to enemy units.
(You can rewrite default arguments although that's irrelevant)
